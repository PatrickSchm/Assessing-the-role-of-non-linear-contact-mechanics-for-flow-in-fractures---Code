ugdemo - description of the ugdemo problems

INTRODUCTION:

ugdemo is a shell script which executes a number of demo scripts.
Just typing 

.vb
ugdemo
.ve

gives a list of available demo scripts. They can be started by

.vb
ugdemo <demo>
.ve

Here, you get a short description.

dc2d and dc3d: 

This is a finite volume discretization by Schneider and Raw
for the Navier Stokes equation.
The driven cavity example is documented in the scripts which can be
found in 'ns/appl2d/scripts/ugdemo.scr' and 
'ns/appl3d/scripts/DrivenCavity.scr'.
There, all configuration parameters are explained in detail. 

df2d: 

This is a density driven flow discretization in 2d.
The pressure and the salt concentration are simulated,
the flow can be computed from this.
This model is used for the groundwater simulation in a salt dome.
The example is documented in the script which can be
found in 'df/gen/appl/scripts'.
There, all configuration parameters are explained in detail. 

pm2d: 

This is the poros media equation in 2d
	
du/dt = delta (u*u).

The script performs 5 time steps with the backward Euler scheme
and a linearization by numerical differentiation.

tu2d: 

This is a tutorial script for a simple scalar equation
where you get online explanations for every line in the script.

ep2d and ep3d:

This are examples for elasto-plasticitic simulations for the
Prantl-Reuss model of perfect plasticity.
The method uses the Simo-Taylor lineariziation and the
backward Euler scheme with line search and step length control.

ball: 

This example shows the local refinement of a ball for
the diffusion equation with diffusion constant 0.001 in the inner ball
and 1 else.

Warning: up to now, this works with one processor only! 

disc: 

This example shows the local refinement of a reentrant corner domain
for P1 and P2 conforming elements, Crouziex-Raviart nonconforming elements,
Raviart-Thomas elements of order 0 and 1 and BDM elements.
Warning: up to now, this works with one processor only! 

diff: 

This example shows the local refinement of a ball for
a diffusion equation varying diffusion constants in 2d
for Raviart-Thomas elements.

er2d: 

Here, an error bound in the energy norm for the 
modified Emden equation

- delta u = u*u + 800 * sin(pi x) * sin (pi y)

is computed. This method can be used to prove the existence of
four different solution of this equations.  

ew2d:

This demonstrates the computation of the 3 lowest eigenvalues
of the Wolfgangsee. It is simulated by the Laplace equation with
Neumann boundary conditions.
